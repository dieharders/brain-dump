# üç∫ Obrew Studio - WebUI

Obrew Studio is a tool for building custom Ai agents and workflows. It is built to support rapid Ai app development at no cost.

## Introduction

The goal of this project are:

1. Provide the easiest way for anyone to install and run open-source Ai locally
2. Provide "batteries included" building blocks (RAG, models, UI, server, memory, etc) for Ai Engineers
3. Support fast and cheap development on commodity hardware

## How It Works

A simple WebUI which performs all its' functions via [Obrew Server](https://github.com/dieharders/ai-text-server). You can use it to interface with a server running locally or a hosted server.
