## Introduction

The goal of this project are:

1. Provide the easiest way for anyone to install and run open-source Ai locally
2. Provide "batteries included" building blocks (RAG, models, UI, server, memory, etc) for Ai Engineers
3. Support fast and cheap development on commodity hardware

## How It Works

Obrew Studio is the WebUI tool used to talk to Obrew Server which performs all Ai workloads. It is required to install locally or host [Obrew Server](https://github.com/dieharders/obrew-studio-server).
