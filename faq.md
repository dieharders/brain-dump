# About oBrew

## What is OpenBrew Ai?

OpenBrew is the idea that building with Ai should be fun and easy.

OpenBrew Ai is an organization focused on maker friendly tools and products capable of tackling actual problems.

## What is oBrew?

oBrew is like a moddable game engine for local Ai. It comes with all the basics needed for an LLM OS.

## Why oBrew?

I found it difficult to install many popular Ai tools. None have enough features so I have to install several other plugins/models.

So I decided to build something that was

- easy to install
- came with batteries included
- free to use and run

## Who is this for?

If you are a hacker, Ai Engineer, Prompt Engineer, Python developer, Web Dev, then this is for you.

All you will need at minimum is to be able to write instructions in natural language.

## What can be done with this?

- You can run it locally to automate tasks or deploy it on a server.
- Write an Ai app that uses the oBrew API to handle any Ai request.
- You can easily extend its functionality to perform new tasks.
- Use it to experiment with new models, hyper-parameters or prompts.
